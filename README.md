# XRayField
Minecraft plugin to detect x-raying using some math and physics.

This plugin was initially developed as a final project for the multivariable calculus class at the Packer Collegiate Institute. You can find an explanation of the theory underlying the plugin [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1BOOAECXTDoWGliaWF0dE9xSUk/preview). If you have questions, contact william.merrill@yale.edu.

Although this project uses Apache math3 for statistical analysis, all the necessary classes are included within the JAR distribution, so there are no dependencies.
