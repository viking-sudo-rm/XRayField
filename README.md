# XRayField
Minecraft plugin to detect x-raying using some math and physics.

This plugin is being developed as a final project for the multivariable calculus class at the Packer Collegiate Institute. Contact wimerrill@packer.edu for more info.

Although this project uses Apache math3 for statistical analysis, all the necessary classes are included within the JAR distribution, so there are no dependencies.
